Sensory systems are explored with respect to the function, the principles of the underlying information processing, and their physiological implementation in the organism. To understand the value of specialized sensory systems, the course also discusses the context in which sensory systems are used, and the constraints that may limit their evolution. Technical solutions to sensory problems in robotics are discussed and compared to those invented by natural evolution.
